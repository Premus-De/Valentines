            <p class="p3">Baby ,it seems so far still can't lie there , but gotta believe we'll get there together and you'll be in my arms just letting go 
                completely and being vulnerable because you'll be safe with me ,, I feel the same way , 
                I want to seee you everytime but unlucky about the distance but it's what has proven our
                 love for each other and we're still strong together , I got your back sweetie,, just a little longer and I'll hold you.❤️</p>
