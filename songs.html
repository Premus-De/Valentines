            <div>
                <p class="p1">This is one of my major love songs that I dediate to you , i would sing but theres 
                    no artist in me and so I choose to highlight it here , you can listen to it in our playlist 
                    and maybe you'll get a gist of what I mean when I dedicate it to you.
