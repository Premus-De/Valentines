                 your overwhelming thoughts or give you the love and affection you so deeply desire right
                  now,, so I dunno how I can convey my love in these words to try and make you feel my
                   affection and care ,but I always say I'm here for you , yes I won't be around all the
                    time but whenever I'm back you can run to me and tell me all about it and I'll listen 
                    and truly be there and comfort my baby till she doesn't feel sad anymore, 
                    I Love you so much baby🌹</p>
